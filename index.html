          <h3 class="topic">These Imaginary Acts: a Novel</h3>
          <div class="project-box">
            <p>
              These Imaginary Acts is the story of Raymond Meeks, whose life has not turned out the way he’d hoped. After a series of family tragedies took his mother to a psychiatric hospital, Raymond dropped out of high school and left his hometown of Auburn, Ohio, with vague aspirations of becoming a filmmaker. Fifteen years later, he’s no closer to Hollywood—in fact, he hasn’t even crossed the Continental Divide. He’s just lost his job editing TV promos for a local news station not two hours from Auburn. He’s alone. He sold his car to make rent. Not knowing what next to do, he calls his old friend, Kelly, for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kelly Suthpin had been meant for great things, when he was seventeen. He was charismatic, handsome, envied. His mother shouted his name at his diving competitions, certain that his Olympic prowess would bring them a magnificent future. But now, living in Kelly’s spare bedroom, Raymond is having a difficult time recognizing the boy he’d once adored. This Kelly has gained weight. He works at the pharmacy of a noisy supermarket chain. He blows off steam at a gun range. He fights with his wife, Dee, who Raymond begins to suspect is just as disenchanted with the person Kelly has become.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raymond finds himself competing with his old friend. He starts to dream up new movies and new, faraway futures for himself, as though the past fifteen years had been nothing more than an interruption. And as the cracks in Kelly’s marriage deepen, Raymond decides that Dee has given up far too much to stay, as Raymond’s mother had stayed, trapped in this small town. Dee needs a new life. She needs a partner who’s adventurous, daring, the man Raymond is determined to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              The novel also blends elements of historical fiction as Raymond, having found a job projecting OMNIMAX movies at the Cincinnati Museum, becomes fascinated with the subject of its latest film—Major A. B. Rogers, the eccentric nineteenth-century surveyor who discovered a deadly mountain pass in the Canadian Rockies, nearly going mad in the process. As he narrates Rogers’s incredible story, Raymond decides that greatness does not have to contain itself in the postcard frames of history. Mountains can still be conquered. Tracks can still be laid. And if Kelly has lost sight of his own ambitions, maybe it’s time for Raymond Meeks to take his place, in whatever way he can.
